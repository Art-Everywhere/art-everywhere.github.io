## User Wallet Management and Minting Options

In Art Everywhere, users interact with the platform through their Ethereum wallets. Here's an exploration of two potential user scenarios:

### Option 1: Metamask Authentication with Backend Minting

-   **Pros:**

    -   Users leverage the security and familiarity of MetaMask.
    -   Simplifies backend integration, leveraging MetaMask's web3 provider.

-   **Cons:**
    -   Users need a MetaMask wallet and some ETH for gas fees.
    -   Slightly more complex initial setup for users.

### Option 2: Backend-Managed Crypto Wallets

-   **Pros:**

    -   Complete control and management by the backend.
    -   Streamlines onboarding for less experienced users.

-   **Cons:**
    -   Development complexity is significantly higher.
    -   Potential security and responsibility concerns.

#### Recommendation:

Considering simplicity and development efficiency, Option 1 is recommended. It balances user familiarity and backend management efficiency.
